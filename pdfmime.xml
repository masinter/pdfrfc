	PDF, the 'Portable Document Format', is an ISO standard
	(ISO 32000-1:2008) defining a final-form document
	representation language in use for document exchange,
	including on the Internet, since 1993.  This document
	provides an overview of the PDF format and updates the
	media type registration of 'application/pdf'. It
	replaces RFC 3778.

    <section title='Introduction'>
      <t>
	This document is intended to provide updated information
	on the registration of the MIME Media Type
	"application/pdf" for documents defined in the PDF <xref
	target='ISOPDF'/>, 'Portable Document Format', syntax.
	Additionally, this document provides a brief history of
	the PDF format, describes several of the key
	capabilities of the format and addresses some security
	concerns.
      </t>
      <t>
	PDF is used widely in the Internet community.  The first
	version of PDF, 1.0, was published in 1993 by Adobe
	Systems [REF needed].  Since then PDF has grown to be a
	widely-used format for capturing and exchanging
	formatted documents electronically across the Web, via
	e-mail and virtually every other document exchange
	mechanism.  In 2008, PDF 1.7 was published as an ISO
	standard <xref target='ISOPDF'/>, ISO 32000-1:2008.
      </t>
      <t>
	PDF represents "final form" formatted documents with a
	fixed layout and appearance.  PDF pages may include
	text, images, graphics and multimedia content such as
	video and audio.  PDF is also capable of containing
	higher level structures including annotations,
	bookmarks, file attachments, hyperlinks, logical
	structure and metadata.  A rich JavaScript model has
	been defined for interacting with PDF documents.
      </t>
      <t>
	PDF supports encryption and digital signatures.  The
	encryption capability is combined with access control
	information to facilitate management of the
	functionality available to the recipient.  PDF supports
	the inclusion of metadata through XMP <xref
	target='XMP'/> metadata as well as directly via PDF
	structures.
      </t>
      <t>
	In addition to the ISO 32000-1:2008 PDF standard,
	several ISO PDF subset standards have been defined to
	address specific use cases.  These standards include PDF
	for Archival (PDF/A), PDF for Engineering (PDF/E), PDF
	for Universal Accessibility (PDF/UA), PDF for Variable
	Data and Transactional Printing (PDF/VT) and PDF for
	Prepress Digital Data Exchange (PDF/X).  The subset
	standards are fully compliant PDF files capable of being
	displayed in a general PDF viewer.
      </t>
      <t>
	PDF usage is widespread enough for 'application/pdf' to
	be used in other IETF specifications. RFC 2346 <xref
	target='RFC2346'/> describes how to better structure PDF
	files for international exchange of documents where
	different paper sizes are used; HTTP byte range
	retrieval is illustrated using application/pdf (RFC 2616
	<xref target='RFC2616'/>, Section 19.2); RFC 3297 <xref
	target='RFC3297'/> illustrates how PDF can be sent to a
	recipient in a way that identifies the user's ability to
	accept the PDF using content negotiation.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title='History'>
      <t>
	PDF was originally envisioned as a way to communicate
	and view printed information electronically across a
	wide variety of machine configurations, operating
	systems, and communication networks in a reliable
	manner.
      </t>
      <t>
	PDF relies on the same fundamental imaging model as the
	PostScript <xref target="PS"/> page description language
	to render complex text, images, and graphics in a device
	and resolution-independent manner, bringing this feature
	to the screen as well as the printer.  However, unlike
	PostScript, PDF enforces page independence, ensuring
	that any page in a document can render without having to
	render previous pages. Additionally, PDF reduces the
	complexity of processing content to improve performance
	for interactive viewing.  In addition to the rendering
	capabilities, PDF also includes objects, such as
	hypertext links and annotations, that are not part of
	the page itself, but are useful for navigation, building
	collections of related documents and for reviewing and
	commenting on documents.
      </t>
      <t>
	The application/pdf media type was first registered in
	1993 by Paul Lindner for use by the gopher protocol and
	was subsequently updated in 1994 by Steve Zilles.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section anchor='compat' title='PDF Implementations'>
      <t>
	There are a number of widely available, independently
	implemented, interoperable implementations of PDF for a wide
	variety of platforms and systems.  Since the PDF specification
	was published and freely available since the format was
	introduced in 1993, hundreds of companies and organizations,
	including web-browser developers, make PDF creation, viewing,
	and manipulation tools for many years prior to ISO
	standardization of PDF.
      </t>
      <t>
	TODO: Update the above list to ensure relevance to
	update market conditions...
      </t>
    </section>
    <section anchor='security' title='Security Considerations'>
      <t>
	TODO: Clean up of this section is still required...
      </t>
      <t>
	An "application/pdf" resource contains information to be
	parsed and processed by the recipient's PDF system.
	Because PDF is both a representation of formatted
	documents and a container system for the resources need
	to reproduce or view said documents, it is possible that
	a PDF file has embedded resources not described in the
	PDF Reference.
      </t>
      <t>
	Although it is not a defined feature of PDF, a PDF
	processor could extract these resources and store them
	on the recipients system.  Furthermore, a PDF processor
	may accept and execute "plug-in" modules accessible to
	the recipient.  These may also access material in the
	PDF file or on the recipients system.  Therefore, care
	in establishing the source, security, and reliability of
	such plug-ins is recommended.  Message-sending software
	should not make use of arbitrary plug-ins without prior
	agreement on their presence at the intended recipients.
	Message-receiving and -displaying software should make
	sure that any non-standard plug-ins are secure and do
	not present a security threat.
      </t>
      <t>
	PDF may contain "scripts" to customize the displaying
	and processing of PDF files.  These scripts are
	expressed in a version of JavaScript.  They are intended
	for execution by the PDF processor.  User agents
	executing such scripts or programs must be extremely
	careful to insure that untrusted software is executed in
	a protected environment.
      </t>
      <t>
	In general, any information stored outside of the direct
	control of the user -- including referenced application
	software or plug-ins and embedded files, scripts or
	other material not covered in the PDF Reference -- can
	be a source of insecurity, by either obvious or subtle
	means.  For example, a script can modify the content of
	a document prior to its being displayed.  Thus, the
	security of any PDF document may be dependent on the
	resources referenced by that document.
